# Credits and licenses

This repository is a community fork of
[facebookincubator/muse-gadget-sdk](https://github.com/facebookincubator/muse-gadget-sdk)
that adds ESP32-S3 boards: so far the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.85C, the
OSTB-3ST and the LCDWIKI 2.8inch ESP32-S3 Display. It is not affiliated with
or endorsed by Meta, Waveshare, Espressif, LCDWIKI, the xiaozhi-esp32 project
or the OSTB-3ST's maker.

This file records where the code came from and under which terms. It is a
plain-language record, not legal advice.

## 1. The Muse Gadget SDK (upstream)

| License | Apache License, Version 2.0, in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) |
| Forked from | commit `b9008abba7dc4109c66212b9b82e459d08b98b85` |

Everything in this repository that is not listed in sections 2 to 4 is the
upstream SDK, unchanged.

Upstream keeps these third-party files under their own licenses:

| Path | Upstream | License |
|---|---|---|
| [`esp32/components/minimp3/include/minimp3.h`](esp32/components/minimp3) | [lieff/minimp3](https://github.com/lieff/minimp3) | CC0-1.0, see [`LICENSE`](esp32/components/minimp3/LICENSE) |
| [`esp32/main/pixel_font.c`](esp32/main/pixel_font.c) | Adafruit GFX `glcdfont.c` | BSD-2-Clause, in the file header |

**The Apache License does not cover the [Jollybot avatar](esp32/avatar).** Its
files carry only a Meta copyright line. Firmware built from this repository
includes that avatar unless you replace it with your own
(`esp32/tools/muse/AVATAR_RECIPE.md`).

## 2. Changes made in this fork

Copyright (c) 2026 ledienbien-ai. Licensed under the Apache License,
Version 2.0, the same license as upstream.

Files added:

|---|---|
| [`esp32/components/muse/boards/board_waveshare_s3_185c.c`](esp32/components/muse/boards/board_waveshare_s3_185c.c) | The 1.85C: display, touch, both audio versions, button, battery, power |
| [`esp32/components/muse/boards/waveshare_s3_185c_lcd_init.h`](esp32/components/muse/boards/waveshare_s3_185c_lcd_init.h) | ST77916 register table (see section 3) |

| `doc/image/` | Pictures for the READMEs: the UI at each added board's screen size, drawn by the simulator. They show the default Jollybot avatar, which the Apache License does not cover (section 1) |
| [`esp32/components/muse/muse_lang.c`](esp32/components/muse/muse_lang.c), `muse_lang.h` | The screen's language, and its texts in Vietnamese |
| [`esp32/components/muse/muse_fonts.c`](esp32/components/muse/muse_fonts.c), `muse_fonts.h` | The fonts each language uses |

| `CREDITS.md`, `README.vi.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `README.ja.md`, `README.ko.md` | This file and the translated READMEs |

`doc/image/db-robot-logo.png` is the same logo as a picture, for the READMEs.
`doc/image/` also holds pictures of the boards themselves.
`waveshare-s3-185c-muse.jpg` is ledienbien-ai's own photo.
`waveshare-s3-185c-device.jpg`, `ostb-3st-device.jpg`, `lcdwiki-s3-28-device.jpg`
and `lcdwiki-s3-28-back.jpg` were supplied by this
fork's owner and look to be the makers' or sellers' product pictures: they are
here to show which hardware is meant, belong to their owners, and are not
under the Apache License.

Fonts added, under their own license, for the Vietnamese letters that LVGL's
built-in fonts lack. Each file is a subset of the font converted to LVGL's
format with [lv_font_conv](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_font_conv), and names
its source and license at the top:

| Path | Font | License |
|---|---|---|
| `esp32/components/muse/fonts/muse_font_montserrat_vi_14.c`, `_16.c`, `_20.c` | [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) Medium, Copyright 2011 The Montserrat Project Authors | SIL Open Font License 1.1, in [`OFL-Montserrat.txt`](esp32/components/muse/fonts/OFL-Montserrat.txt) |

Upstream files modified, each marked "Modified by ledienbien-ai" under its
license header, as section 4(b) of the Apache License asks:

| Path | Change |
|---|---|

| `esp32/README.md`, `esp32/AGENTS.md`, `esp32/devices/README.md`, `esp32/devices/AGENTS.md` | List the new boards; `AGENTS.md` also says how on-screen text gets its Vietnamese |
| `esp32/components/muse/Kconfig`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `idf_component.yml` | Register the boards, the 1.85C's `esp_lcd_st77916` dependency and the LCDWIKI board's `esp_lcd_ili9341`; the startup logo's options; the starting language and spoken replies |
| `esp32/components/muse/muse_ui.c` | On round screens smaller than 412 px, the speaker button sits under the state word. On a rectangular screen under 300 px tall (the OSTB-3ST's 296×240), a smaller Muse and a bar in place of the ring. The startup logo. The screen in Vietnamese: its texts, its fonts and the room their taller lines need |
| `esp32/components/muse/muse_settings_ui.c` | Settings pages that fit a screen that short; a "Muse AI by DB-robot" line under the settings list; the pages in Vietnamese and a Language page |
| `esp32/components/muse/muse_settings.c`, `muse_settings.h`, `muse_app.c`, `muse_ble.c` | The language setting: kept in NVS, applied at startup, set with the `lang` setup command |
| `esp32/components/muse/muse_text.c`, `muse_text.h`, `muse_chat_text.c` | Vietnamese letters kept in Vietnamese and made plain in English; the transcript's tail counted in characters |

## 4. Components fetched at build time

The firmware links components that the ESP-IDF Component Manager downloads
into `esp32/managed_components/`. They are not stored in this repository and
each keeps its own license. For these boards they include:

| Component | License |
|---|---|
| [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) v6.0.1 | Apache-2.0 |
| `espressif/esp_lcd_st77916` (1.85C only), `esp_lcd_ili9341` (LCDWIKI board only), `esp_lvgl_adapter`, `esp_lcd_touch`, `esp_codec_dev`, `esp_websocket_client`, `led_strip`, `button`, `knob`, `esp_lv_fs`, `esp_lv_decoder`, `esp_mmap_assets`, `cmake_utilities` | Apache-2.0 |
| `lvgl/lvgl` 9.5.0 | MIT |
| `espressif/cjson` (cJSON) | MIT |
| `espressif/esp_new_jpeg` | Espressif MIT |
| `espressif/freetype` | FreeType License |
| `espressif/libpng` | PNG Reference Library License |
| `espressif/zlib` | zlib License |

The simulator's LVGL and SDL are listed in
[`esp32/simulator/THIRD_PARTY.md`](esp32/simulator/THIRD_PARTY.md).

## 5. What the licenses do not give you

- **Names and logos.** The Apache License grants no right to the Meta, Muse,
  Waveshare or Espressif names and marks beyond describing where the work came
  from.
- **The Muse service.** Pairing a gadget needs an SDK token and is governed by
  the [Gadget SDK Terms](https://gadgets.muse.ai/sdk-terms), not by this
  repository's license.
- **Google's text-to-speech.** Spoken replies come from the address behind
  Google Translate's "listen" button (`translate.google.com/translate_tts`).
  It is not a published API and nothing here gives a right to use it: Google's
  terms apply, Google can change or block it at any time, and the text of each
  spoken reply is sent to Google. `CONFIG_MUSE_TTS_GOOGLE=n` builds without it.
- **Warranty.** Everything here is provided "as is". Flashing firmware can
  brick a board.

## 6. Keeping this in order in later versions

- Keep `LICENSE` and this file in the repository and in any source archive.
- Give each new file an Apache header with your own copyright line. Leave the
  headers of upstream and third-party files as they are.
- When you change an upstream file, add or extend the "Modified by" line under
  its header and the table in section 2.
- When you copy code or data from another project, check its license first and
  add a row to section 3, with the notice text if the license asks for one.
- When you publish a firmware `.bin`, link this file and `LICENSE` next to the
  download: a binary is a distribution too. A build made with your SDK token
  carries that token.
